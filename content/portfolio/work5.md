Since June, 2020

Once a prophesied sacred Buddhist land in the Himalayas, then a Buddhist kingdom and eventually an Indian state – historically, Sikkim has seen not only political but also religious changes, influences, and modifications. Even more, recent developments such as climate change, dam building activities and border issues are changing people's lives in many ways.

Religion takes a central place in society. At various points in time a synthesis and coexistence of the different belief systems emerged, which can be considered a form of resilience. But what role does gender play in all of these developments?

Based on an analysis of primary sources, this study examines the role of gender from social norms and religious contexts in a Himalayan Buddhist ambience, taking into account historical and recent developments.
