I am very grateful to all the teachers I have had the pleasure to meet. At the same time, I appreciate the things I can learn in my life, through living, meeting people, travelling... these life lessons enrich me. **Thanks to the teachers who are often unaware that they are teaching me.** However, I have been able to share some of my knowledge with students myself.
