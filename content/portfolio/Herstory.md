*To restore women to history and to restore our history to women* -  Joan Kelly

Join me on my personal journey through history to give women a space to celebrate their achievements and ultimately to bring them back into history.

What is presented as human history is mostly the history of men, with women being excluded over the centuries. Events have been seen and written down through the lens of men. They decided how and what was recorded. By simply not recording the stories and achievements of women who actively shaped their lives and influenced their cultural or religious environment, much has been lost. Thus, in many cases, it was men who decided what or who would become part of the so-called cultural memory and cultural imaginary.

This is a weekly blog (in German) about women and related stereotypes.
