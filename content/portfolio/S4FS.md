[Scientists for Future South Tyrol](https://www.scientistsforfuture.bz/blog/) is an association of scientists whose aim is to actively contribute the current state of science in a well-founded and comprehensible form to the social debate on sustainability and safeguarding the future.

Current measures to protect the climate, species, forests, oceans and soil are far from sufficient. We only have one planet Earth! Humans have clearly lost their connection and relationship with nature ... Hopefully this will be restored.
