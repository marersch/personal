**A journey through the centuries that reflects not only the religious history of a Buddhist tradition, but also cultural, social, political, economic and feminist aspects.** The Barawa Kagyu is one of the many traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded in the 14th century and spread to Tibet, Bhutan and northern India, where it is still alive today.

Long-term research project, since April, 2010

The Barawa tradition has preserved numerous texts, dating from the 14th century to the present day, describing the lives of important personalities, philosophical interpretations and important religious practices. The Barawa Kagyu ('ba' ra ba bka' brgyud) is one of the many traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The Kagyupa (bka' brgyud pa) is one of the main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The term Kagyupa refers to the oral tantric teachings, which are passed from teacher to disciple.

Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang ('Ba' ra ba rGyal mtshan dpal bzang po, 1310-1391) is considered the founding father of the Barawa Kagyupa. He was born in Baradrak ('Ba' ra brag) in the Shangs valley, about 30 km from Shigatse (gZhis ka rtse). This Kagyu offshoot took its name from this place. Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang  also brought the Barawa teachings to Bhutan, to where he undertook several journeys and did not only spread his teachings but also acted as a kind of mediator between local chieftains. As a gesture of gratitude, and probably to encourage him to stay in Bhutan, monasteries were built.

During the 17th century, the teachings of the Barawa teachings spread to Sikkim at that time. Nevertheless, this tradition was not as strong presence as the Nyingma, and the teachings were not as popular as those of the Nyingma. However, it is still practised there up to this day.
