*To be a good human being is to have a kind of openness to the world, an ability to trust uncertain things beyond your own control.* - Martha Nussbaum

My strengths are building bridges between disciplines, bringing in new perspectives and creating space for discussion.

In addition to my most important tool - amazement at seemingly self-evident things - I bring a great deal of erudition and computer skills. My previous employers have appreciated my reliable and conscientious way of working.

I find my balance to my intellectual activity in painting, music, organic gardening, cooking or sewing. 

I am always looking for new intellectual adventures and challenges!
