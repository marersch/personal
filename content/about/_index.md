title: About me
---

In the beginning there was wonder - wonder at the world, at people, at human behaviour, at the broken relationship between man and nature, at people who put themselves before everything else...


![This is me][1]

I see myself as a humanist who, despite specialisation in the sense of a university education, has a broad interest in everything that makes me wonder. I am always looking for new paths, crossroads and, eventually, answers.
